#How it does
This is a simple application is created to mimic the workings of the Contacts on the Mobile Phone. There are three class files:
  - Contacts
  - MobilePhone
  - Main
 
Contacts store the name and phone number. MobilePhone handels the working of printing, adding, updating, and removing the contact. Main class executes those functions.
